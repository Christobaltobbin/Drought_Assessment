# Agriculture Drought Assessment of Matongo Region in Tanzania

## Introduction
Drought is one of the natural disasters which has been intensifying over the years due to the effects of climate change and occurs in areas where there is low precipitation or rainfall due to environmental factors. Drought is considered one of the most complex natural hazards because of its slow onset, long-term impact and negatively affecting the lives of people (Zambrano, Lillo-Saavedra, Verbist, & Lagos, 2016). There are four categories of classifying drought according to Willhite and Glantz and these are; Meteorological drought, Hydrological drought, Agricultural drought and Socio-economic drought (Wilhite & Glantz).
Some of the common methods of agriculture drought monitoring is by using indices such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and crop moisture index (CMI) but these require the long term record of precipitation data (Shen, et al., 2016). Remote sensing-based indices also include vegetation health index (VHI), temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation cover indices (Zambrano, Lillo-Saavedra, Verbist, & Lagos, 2016). For this paper, the vegetation condition index (VCI) which is derived from the difference between the maximum and minimum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values.
