# Agriculture Drought Assessment of Matongo Region in Tanzania

## Introduction
Drought is one of the natural disasters which has been intensifying over the years due to the effects of climate change and occurs in areas where there is low precipitation or rainfall due to environmental factors. Drought is considered one of the most complex natural hazards because of its slow onset, long-term impact and negatively affecting the lives of people (Zambrano, Lillo-Saavedra, Verbist, & Lagos, 2016). There are four categories of classifying drought according to Willhite and Glantz and these are; Meteorological drought, Hydrological drought, Agricultural drought and Socio-economic drought (Wilhite & Glantz).
Some of the common methods of agriculture drought monitoring is by using indices such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and crop moisture index (CMI) but these require the long term record of precipitation data (Shen, et al., 2016). Remote sensing-based indices also include vegetation health index (VHI), temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation cover indices (Zambrano, Lillo-Saavedra, Verbist, & Lagos, 2016). For this paper, the vegetation condition index (VCI) which is derived from the difference between the maximum and minimum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values.

## Study area
Matongo is located in the northern parts of Tanzania, in the Kilimanjaro region and lies between latitude 3.2806° S and  longitude of 37.1958° E. The region has a hilly landscape with elevations ranging from 600 to 1800m above sea level. Matongo falls within the tropical climate with raining  seasons from March to May and between October and December. Matongo is known for its agriculture with crops such as coffee, maize, beans, and bananas being cultivated. In addition to agriculture, the Matongo region is also home to several tourist attractions, including the Kilimanjaro National Park and the Marangu Waterfalls.
Overall, the Matongo region is an important agricultural area in Tanzania, with a favorable climate and fertile soil supporting the production of high-quality crops. Its location near Mount Kilimanjaro also makes it an important tourist destination, contributing to the local economy. The land cover map of Matongo indicates that most of the region is covered by forest and is followed by agriculture and shrubland.
